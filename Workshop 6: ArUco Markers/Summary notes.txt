In this lecture, we covered the use and need of ArUco Markers in ROS.
It is important to note that this might be a little difficult to understand for some people and hence can be skipped for now, when you feel more comfortable with ros2 consider revisiting this.

Topics covered:
    - What are ArUco Markers
    - Why we need them
    - How to generate ArUco Markers
    - How to estimate pose using OpenCV
    - Real World Use of ArUco Markers
