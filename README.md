## Hey everyone! 

So, we the people of the Robotics Club (yes yes, that overly formal intro again) present to you...

No, it's not named after COL106 — (that CG-boosting monster of a course that makes you question your existence — yeah, we know it's tough, that was sarcasm). But don't worry, this isn't one of those theoretical lectures that leave you doubting your degree.

We get it — the word "course" hits a bit too hard these days, especially after... certain grades. So here's the rebrand:
- **It's not a course. It's a workshop.**
- **Wait, better — a bootcamp.**
- **(And of course, we'll make it easier for you — don't worry, we're not professors.)**

## 🤔 What's ROS106 all about?

It's our way of walking you through ROS2 basics — everything we know (and aren't gatekeeping). By the end, you'll be able to build ROS-based robotic applications on your own!

## ⏱️ Duration & Schedule

- **Kickoff**: 19th May 2025, online.
- **Duration**: Just 8 weeks. That's it. Not a semester-long commitment. You'll survive.
- **Weekly Schedule**: 2 workshops per week, each around 2 hours max. (That's less than the time you stand in PYP lab. And here? You sit. Revolutionary.)
  - 1 session covering the week's material (similar to MOOC video lectures)
  - 1 session for doubt-solving and hands-on help

## 📝 Assignments & Rewards

- Yes — take-home assignments.
- Evaluated using a custom evaluator we'll share with you.
- And don't even think about cheating — we made it. We know its secrets.

### 🍔 Night Mess Treat for Best Submission
That's right — best submission at the end of the bootcamp gets a full-on night mess treat. And no, I will not just buy you a roll. I promise more. (You'll see. *evil laugh intensifies*)

## 🔧 What will you build?

No real robots this time (we're not that rich), but you'll get to build cool simulations that behave almost like real bots — without the wiring mess and burnt circuits.

## 🏆 Why should you join?

- Understand what ROS2 actually is
- Build fun stuff without needing physical hardware
- Bragging rights + resume gold
- Occasional roast sessions and group struggles
- And most importantly — you'll learn something without hating your life
