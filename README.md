## Hey everyone! 

So, we the people of the Robotics Club present to you...

We get it ‚Äî the word "course" hits a bit too hard these days, especially after... certain grades. So here's the rebrand:
- **It's not a course. It's a workshop.**
- **Wait, better ‚Äî a bootcamp.**

## ü§î What's ROS106 all about?

It's our way of walking you through ROS2 basics ‚Äî everything we know. By the end, you'll be able to build ROS-based robotic applications on your own!

## ‚è±Ô∏è Duration & Schedule

- **Kickoff**: 19th May 2025, online.
- **Duration**: Just 6 weeks. 
- **Weekly Schedule**: 2 workshops per week, each around 2 hours max. 

## üîß What will you build?

No real robots this time, but you'll get to build cool simulations that behave almost like real bots ‚Äî without the wiring mess and burnt circuits.

## üèÜ Why should you join?

- Understand what ROS2 actually is
- Build fun stuff without needing physical hardware
- Bragging rights + resume gold
- And most importantly ‚Äî you'll learn something without hating your life
